# inside feature branches it's handy to change the 'version' field to match the branch name
# as reported by the Github Action workflow 'publish.yaml', so that you can force HomeAssistant
# to use the docker image of that feature branch instead of the docker image of 'main', by pointing
# HomeAssistant to that feature branch
